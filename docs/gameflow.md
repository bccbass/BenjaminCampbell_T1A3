# General Gameflow:

1. Welcome user and ask for name

2. Display round number, and remaining rounds in game (this is finite and dicated by board length)

3. prompt for first roll (maybe just 'enter'?)
display roll and query which numbers to keep, which to reroll. Confirm decision and roll remaining dice. *there is option to move to next round without re-rolling as well*
This occurs a total of 3 iterations. 

4. Display final hand and determine what category hand will be applied to. 

5. Tally score, add to card and display

*This process repeats until all rounds have finished.* 

*The singular exception to this flow is for Yahtzee - this is a hand with all the same numbers. Player can log unlimited number of yahtzees, and subsequent yahtzees are worth double points.* 

6. When game has finished Congratulations, Final Score and comparative stats from game logs.

7. Option is given to Exit or Play again
