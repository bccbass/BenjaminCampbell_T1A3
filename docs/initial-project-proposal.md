# Yahtzee Project Proposal:

Submitted proposal:  

I'd like to create a version of the classic dice game yahtzee. In it the player has three rolls per turn to create a 'hand' that matches a category(full house, 3 of a kind, yahtzee, etc.). Every category can only be used once. The goal is to create a card with the highest score. some features to implement:
Start with lower half of board(full house, 3 of a kind, yahtzee etc)
Create random 5 dice roll
User gets three rolls and can choose which dice to save and which to roll again on each roll with an option to stop rolling before 3 rolls is reached
Users score card is presented before each turn so they know what categories they still need to check off
Program verifies what categories final roll fit into then logs points and crosses out category
Program would save user scores and congratulate high scorers
Extended features wish list:
Multi Player
Add Upper half of card (1s, 2s, 3s, bonus)
Allow user to choose which category theyâ€™d like their roll to apply to as opposed to auto calculating
